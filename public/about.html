<h1><strong>About Me</strong></h1>
<p> I'm a passionate web developer, love coding, dedicated to crafting elegant and showing creative works. I love to turn ideas into reality, using my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript,etc. to build responsive and user-friendly websites. </p>
<p> I also use python in building backend, using the django framework. 
Beyond coding, I'm a problem-solver at heart, always eager to learn and adapt to new challenges. When I am not writing code, you can always find me alone with God or with my love ones.

<p>I'm excited to connect and collaborate on your next project!" </p>
